This achievement is particularly meaningful to me because it demonstrates the power of hard work and the importance of persistence in the face of challenges.

Rowing has also taught me important lessons about teamwork, communication, and leadership, all of which are skills that I believe are transferable to other areas of my life and career.

I took a class called Women in Entrepreneurship with Kendra Scott, where we were given the option to pitch a business idea. I pitched my idea for an all-in-one shopping platform. After we all pitched our ideas, we were put into teams. I was put into a team where the founder was creating an all-in-one wedding dress website. She then proceeded to take all the fundamental elements of my idea and apply them to her niche.
When I brought up how this bothered me to my professor, she gave me valuable feedback. She suggested that regardless of her taking inspiration from me, I should still stay on the team to learn the feasibility of my idea applied to this niche. At first, I was confused that she didn't understand why it upset me. However, after thinking about it for a few days, I saw the value in her feedback. Regardless of me staying on the team or not, the girl would proceed to use my idea anyway. I realized that I would rather stay and learn from them trying to research and build a minimum viable product from it rather than leave with nothing. Additionally, I cared more about the impact it would make, regardless of it being my idea or not. Therefore, it would be more valuable for me to contribute to the group as well.
From this experience, I learned the importance of taking a step back and assessing the situation before reacting. I was initially upset that someone took my idea, but I learned that it was not about who came up with the idea but rather about the impact the idea could make. I also learned the importance of being open to feedback, even when it is difficult to hear.

Before, we'd been telling the underclassmen what to do: clean up after yourselves, participate in class activities, and be respectful to teachers and classmates. However, that wasn't working, so we came up with a leadership-by-example model: we would pick up the school's clutter, hype up events, and be more proactive in classes.

Given the thought our team put into coming up with our idea, we were a bit discouraged to hear how the audience couldn't see the value our CUI brought for users. 

However, when our team re-evaluated our idea, we felt the confusion our audience and professor experienced may have been do to our poor delivery rather than a lacking concept. Thus, for our next critique, we worked to better prepare a presentation that would be intuitive and clear. We worked on creating models that helped visualize how our CUI worked in conjunction with the problem space each feature tackled. We also created a video of our team conducting an experience prototype in order to provide even more visualization of our idea. 

Our team used this opportunity to really think about how our CUI could be more than a ""solution"" but rather an enhanced experience to a current problem. Our preparations resulted in a complete change in the audience's reaction. Interestingly, from my team's perspective, our idea didn't change too much between the iterations, but to the audience, our CUI went from an unclear and meaningless idea to one that added complexity, provided enjoyment, and inspired curiosity. I think this big jump in how our work was perceived came from our improved method of communicating our vision to the audience. 

We also saw how this impacted the type of responses and feedback we received. During our first critique, the feedback we received told us to take a step backwards and reorganize the foundation of our idea.

Simply put, the music notes written on one page for a viola will look different from a page for a violin, even if they’re the same exact notes. 

Imagine this: you try out and make the pit orchestra for your high school musical. Exciting! Except for two things: first, you’re a violist, so there are only two other people in your section (AKA, you really can’t fake playing), and secondly, all the music is in treble clef and you never learned how to play the piano, so you’re kind of screwed because you can’t read the music.

I was stressed out, to say the least. But I lived and breathed treble clef for a solid month, at one point even dreaming about the notes dancing in my sleep. I went from literally writing out the letters on top of each note to being able to play 200 pages of music in time with the orchestra. 

My growth came from hours of practice with my fellow violists, both of whom were just as stressed but also as determined to play beautifully and commit. I just know I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them; a few tears may or may not have been shed together in despair, but we motivated each other and made it through.

The platform would utilize AI-driven data analytics and insights to provide real-time, actionable recommendations to business leaders.

To bring this idea to life, the first step would be to conduct extensive market research and analysis to identify key pain points and opportunities in the market. This would involve engaging with potential customers and conducting surveys and interviews to gather insights.

Once we have a clear understanding of the market and its needs, the second step would be to build a team of data scientists, AI experts, and software engineers to develop the platform. This team would be responsible for building the algorithms and models that power the data analytics and insights, as well as developing the software that allows customers to access and use the platform.

Pinwheel offers me an amazing opportunity in which I can pursue this goal by helping an audience I care a lot about, which is youth in their maturing stages. Pinwheel also provides the opportunity for me to take a unique approach to the topic of smartphones and youth. I believe that this topic has become a very pressing current issue due to the fact that smartphones have become a necessity rather than a privilege. Even when I was growing up, having a smartphone was something that set someone apart, but now, the lack of a smartphone can be not only an inconvenience but a possible risk to a child’s safety and even a cause for social isolation. With that being said, I think that mainstream phones available from companies like Apple and Samsung do not provide adequate protection for youth. With the ease of access to potentially harmful areas of the internet that showcase nudity or violence, I believe there needs to be an alternative that allows kids to be kids, while simultaneously allowing for some level of control and boundaries set by guardians.

The mission of Pinwheel is especially meaningful to me because I have 3 cousins that are between the ages of 5-7 and are already being introduced to phones and tablets. Seeing them with their electronics, I find it essential for them to grow up without being exposed to harmful content and to figure out an innovative way to allow them to be positively impacted by the amazing technology we have today, without being negatively impacted by drawbacks presented by the same technology. I believe I can be a great asset to Pinwheel by providing my insight as someone who has lived through the explosion of social media and has studied technology used for social good. I believe I can also offer a unique perspective of someone who sees the great potential and benefit of electronics but understands the drawbacks. At Pinwheel, I will play my part in the great battle for safe technology by helping to create a product that is reliable, simple, and fun.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

It was a very miserable spreadsheet, over 500 rows long, and color-coded in highlighter yellow, neon green, or bright red. They needed 2 people to do this spreadsheet work because it was very taxing.

I counter-offered my employer and offered to transform their spreadsheet into an automated internal tool for the admin to use. They gladly accepted, excited to see my vision come to reality.

I started by noting all the key functions of the spreadsheet. Then, I moved into user interviews, asking all those at the company who interacted with the spreadsheet how they used it and what purposes it served. Taking this data, I constructed a Figma prototype. I then asked users of the spreadsheet to use this brand-new ATS that followed a Kanban board layout. When one tile was moved into a different column, it automatically sent an email to the applicant so that no human had to do the manual work of sending out templates. I collected feedback, iterated my prototype, and handed it off to the Product Designer to be implemented.

I am happy to say that this cut down the workload for the company by 50%. Instead of having me come on to help another employee with the spreadsheet, only one person could spend a fraction of their original time on the ATS.

My main responsibility was to create a facilitator manual for the program that integrated both the parent/caregiver and youth workshops, one hour for each, with an additional hour for a family session. This was a significant challenge, as the original workshops were two hours each, and it was important to maintain the flow and structure of each session within the limited timeframe.

To tackle this challenge, I researched other parenting program handbooks to identify what activities were being used and how they flowed. I learned that the family portion should be an extension of the previous sessions, which allowed me to extract the most important sections and incorporate new activities where appropriate. I also reached out to parenting educators and professionals to gather suggestions on how to engage participants, caregivers and children respectively, and what examples to include in the workshops.

Throughout the project, I met regularly with my supervisors to ask for feedback and ensure that the components included were of high quality and completeness. By the end of the internship, I successfully compiled the first edition of the manual, and the program committee planned to pilot it this year.

This experience taught me the importance of research, communication, and adaptability in tackling complex projects. I also learned the importance of seeking feedback and continuously improving the project to meet the needs of the participants.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.157000+00:00

Having been a community mentor and organizer in other capacities, I recognized the heightened need for food security during this unprecedented pandemic.  I wanted to enact long-term, not short, change, so I took the time to devise and execute mutual aid systems within my town through mobilizing and garnering much needed financial and physical support through community members to maintain monthly food supply and distribution. I collaborated with local farms and grocers to divert food from waste and provide steady deliveries of food to families suffering from COVID-induced layoffs and isolation, and I am currently working towards establishing a community “fridge” for the often neglected homeless and underserved in my town. 
As the pandemic continued and the fight for racial justice heightened, I further mobilized the teens within our grassroots to bolster minority turnout in the upcoming election. I developed and facilitated a phone bank and door-to-door campaign reaching 20,000+ minority voters within our town to turn out for local and national candidates. I established a partnership between Operation Helping Hand and the local newspaper to host interviews with local candidates led by my fellow organizers and myself, and in a broader effort, I involved our organizers in national door-to-door efforts through a partnership with Seed the Vote and Generation Rising in order to bolster minority voter turnout within the swing states of Pennsylvania and Arizona. 
Throughout this entire process, I appreciate the opportunities to connect with my peers and help them effectively contribute to the fight for collective liberation of marginalized communities. Having attended 3 Title I schools and experiencing the hurdles of growing up in a first-generation, low-income home, I recognize the systemic roadblocks that continue to limit the BIPOC communities from which I learned and developed, and it is because of these communities I contribute to long-lasting and effective changes to ensure we all thrive.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.160000+00:00

Although the data that I put into the spreadsheets were precise, I usually update the task late which impacted the analysis process and decision of the leader. At that time, I was overwhelmed with my things such as taking the SAT, playing sports, and applying for college. I was not using any excuse to defend my mistake to the project leader. A few days after receiving the complaint, I met with the leader to apologize for my irresponsibility and bad time management which badly affected the whole project. I also openly discuss my personal difficulties with the leader. We both agree to reduce my workload for a month. In the meantime, I tried to look for team members from other departments who have knowledge of analysis to cover a portion of my tasks. I tried my best to provide resources and assistance to the people who were covering my tasks. After I was done with my college application process, I got back to work and pick up whatever other members were working on. Since that incident, I reflect on myself and figure out my issue with time management so I recreated a work plan that requires less time that generates the same quality results.

This single word is both the title of the course I am currently enrolled in and the first sentence of the novel Beethoven Hero by Scott Burnham. I took this course, which is unrelated to my major, as a way of connecting with my background as a violinist and to explore the background of one of the most recognized composers in history. Although our quarter has just begun, I feel as though I already have so many questions about this topic. What makes Beethoven so great? Those who took up composing after Beethoven always saw him as the pinnacle of music composition and someone to be compared to. Richard Wagner, known as a rising talent at the time, took the role as the supposed heir to the throne and used themes from Beethoven’s famous pieces in his own compositions as a sort of tribute. What did Beethoven do that was different from other composers of his time? Why did many composers see him as both a rival and an obstacle? I find it fascinating how our understanding of Beethoven’s life can help interpret not only his music, but other composers’ music as well. An interesting fact I learned was that there are a number of locks of Beethoven’s hair around the world – Only a handful of which are actually his. The theory that Beethoven died of lead poisoning was actually debunked after DNA testing was done on the lock of hair that had traces of lead, and it was found that the hair belonged to a Jewish woman!",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

Once I was doing a teaching demonstration during an audit, and I handled a teaching situation poorly, leaving the missionaries feeling confused and discouraged. Immediately after the demonstration, my manager pulled me aside and let me know exactly what I did wrong, telling me that my demonstration was hard to follow and ineffective. It hurt to hear this feedback as I had spent a lot of time preparing this demonstration. However, I thanked my manager for the feedback and planned to do better the next time. 

The following week, I reported to my manager my goal and plans to do better in my upcoming demonstration, and I asked if I could report to her on my progress. She agreed, and for the next few months, I made this weakness of mine a focus point. During this experience, I saw major improvement in my teaching demonstrations and learned several valuable lessons.

Feeling scared and alone, I sat down and cried in front of my house until a neighbor's son saw me and brought me inside. He let me use his phone to call my dad and let him know where I was.

However, in the project of that introduction class, I noticed that we lacked design explorations and iterations, which made me realize that I needed to further develop my design thinking skills. So, at the start of this semester, I embarked on an individual passion project: redesigning WeChat, a communication app that is widely used in China.

By conducting user research and market research, as well as brainstorming, I was able to identify pain points and explore various design ideas, analyzing each one with care. Additionally, I extensively explored different user flows within my designs, carefully weighing the pros and cons of each alternative. This process has enabled me to develop my design thinking skills and has given me the confidence to defend my design decisions.

As I worked on my project, I also attended critique groups with my peers. During these sessions, I learned to look at others' projects and designs critically and give constructive feedback. It was challenging at first, but with practice, I became more comfortable with providing feedback and was able to offer suggestions that were helpful to my peers.

However, when I presented this idea to my Business professor, it was met with harsh criticism and my confidence was shattered. Despite my initial enthusiasm, his skepticism and criticism made me feel unconfident and uncertain about pursuing my dream of starting my own business. 

Upon talking with my friends, I decided to try it out and hosted several successful events. The inaugural show, titled 'Laughter Therapy,' featured budding comics and was promoted through an Instagram page and communication plan. The event sold over 200 tickets and received positive reviews. 30% of the sales were donated to Hemkunt Foundation. The success of this show led to another event for Housemonk, a Singapore-based Real Estate SaaS startup. The success of the second show motivated the entrepreneur in me to take Mauka to the next level, which led me to organize many such shows.

2022 Fall - I was promoted from intern to Product Development Analyst at ThatsClutch.com. I conducted UX Research for dashboard setup, profile editing, and other user tasks on the website. 

2022 Summer - As a UI/UX Intern at ThatsClutch.com, I assisted in UX Research, Figma prototyping, and streamlining internal processes.

2020 - I worked on a team of Mechanical Engineers to prototype, construct, and test a “sensory pod” for the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences.

The first month I woke up at 6am and would hit the gym 5 times a week as a desire to change my life and improve my health. I actually injured my back when I overestimated myself on the deadlift during my 3rd month and had to take a long break, but I came back and did not let pain stop my goal.

I began high school incredibly behind my current peers, being ranked in the top 30% of a class of 750. At the end of my four years, I finished just two people outside the top 6% mark through hard work. My GPA was above 100 on the 100-point scale for three years straight, making up for my poor performance freshman year. I was even awarded the opportunity to speak as a class leader at graduation. 
As a sophomore, I knew that there weren't 180 kids more capable than me, and I was determined to prove it. It was a long three years, but I'm incredibly proud of the confidence I had in myself despite the odds.

N1qNJDhmC1xA,dESsecix,b6gk8xldmaxng1trrqdy60b6gk8qx821,text,,,,"The hardest thing I've ever done was train for my dance Arangetram. An Arangetram is the  debut solo performance of the Indian classical dance style, Bharatanatyam, where a dancer ascends the stage after years of learning and training. An Arangetram is typically a 3-4 hour long performance that takes incredible physical and mental endurance. I had been learning dance for 13 years prior, but really began training a year before my Arangetram. In addition to building up stamina, strength, and stability, I had to manage many details surrounding the logistics of the event, from organizing musicians, booking a venue, and managing seating. As a senior in high school at the time, I was also dealing with considerable academic stress. It was challenging to balance all these things at once, but it taught me very valuable lessons about time management and prioritization. Training for my Arangetram took immense amounts of discipline, because it was such a long-term project with little to no strict ""deadlines"" to meet until the final performance. I learned how to keep myself on track to meet my goals and how to not lose sight of the goal itself.  I also learned how to delegate tasks and manage a team -- after trying to balance all the logistics myself, I realized it was more efficient to assign tasks to my friends and family, who were all eager to help. In the end, I was able to execute a performance I was proud of, especially given the challenges I faced in the journey leading up to it.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00
ULywlK95fOs0,dESsecix,klokmnmpwicmib86h0klokmnzh41i4k9,text,,,,"During my sophomore year, I went through sorority recruitment, a challenging process that resulted in receiving some difficult feedback. The process involves evaluating potential new members based on their personalities and appearance, and making hugs cuts without having to give a reason, and it's easy to feel like something is wrong with you. During one of my recruitment interviews, however, the girl interviewing me shared her experience and advised me not to take it personally. She explained that it's all part of the process, and sometimes a person just doesn't fit what the house is looking for. Initially, it was tough not to take the feedback personally, as the interviewer knew very little about me beyond my appearance and small talk. However, I am an extremely organized individual who likes to document everything. So, as I went through recruitment, I kept notes in a small book about my feelings after each house, what they stood for, who I talked to, and more. By doing this, I was able to understand each sorority's unique ""personality” and “culture""  and eventually found a house where I felt I belonged. This house provided me with lifelong friends, and the experience taught me to be more confident in myself by emphasizing my strengths and unique qualities. By being authentic, I found a house with like-minded people that made my experience enjoyable, instead of trying to fit into a mold that would have led me to a house that wasn’t right for me. I learned that I should stay true to myself, trust the process, receive  feedback constructively and view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Also that there is always something to learn from failure, and reflecting on this set me up for success in the long-run. This lesson has translated closely into my attitude towards internship applications - just because one opportunity does not work out, it does not mean that I am not skilled or valued, it just means that I have to keep looking and learning from my experiences, and the right opportunity will come along.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.157000+00:00

My team and I decided to work on creating a robotics and automation simulation platform/academy for the manufacturing industry. We really started creating this product by asking why are we building this? We saw that manufacturing capabilities during the pandemic did not meet product demand and that there were major labor shortages due to lack of robotics knowledge. 
My role was the project manager, really focusing on creating the project plan, dealing with different aspects such as scope, cost, timelines, gaps in the product ecosystem, and risk/safety issues. My role consisted of facilitating issue resolution and really just leading as new changes and challenges presented themselves as we built the framework necessary to translate the problem space.  Furthermore, while working as a Marketing Associate, I had the opportunity to experience conducting market research, learning how to appeal to a target audience and a changing user based on the product, analyzing competitor data, and working with different global markets.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.160000+00:00

ULywlK95fOs0,dESsecix,yoyf5nt995xk9npl2k98s5yoyf5jcwil,text,,,,"Last year, after attending a 12-week course on computational biology, I applied for a paid summer research fellowship under the same professor; unfortunately, I was denied the position. After seeking feedback from the program director, she told me that despite my strong efforts during the class, she felt that I lacked previous knowledge with programming languages relative to other candidates. Ultimately, my personal growth throughout the 12-week course was not sufficient to offset the pre-existing knowledge gap.
This was very difficult feedback to hear, as I had put a lot of effort and time into my application and had hoped to gain valuable research experience over the summer. However, I didn't let this rejection stop me from pursuing my goals.
Instead, I decided to volunteer at the same research lab that summer, hoping to enhance my technical skill set, which was the main point of weakness addressed in our feedback session. It was a tough decision to volunteer, as it meant giving up my summer job to work for free, but I was determined to learn and grow.
As it turned out, volunteering was the best decision I could have made. Not only did I learn much more than I would have in the paid position, but I was also able to develop relationships with the researchers and gain valuable insights into the world of academic research. In fact, later that semester, I was accepted to serve as an academic mentor for new students in the research lab. 
This experience taught me that sometimes, the best way to grow is to take a risk and step out of your comfort zone. While receiving difficult feedback can be discouraging, it's important to keep pushing forward and seeking out opportunities to learn and improve. In the end, my persistence and willingness to learn helped me gain valuable experience and become a leader in the research community.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.159000+00:00

The broad scope of this project was initially overwhelming, and it felt as though my skills I acquired throughout the semester were being tested. When my progress wasn't meeting my expectations, I was met with hesitation and doubt in my abilities. It was conceptually challenging because the game's principles require calculating the collision physics of colliding with the obstacles. In addition, to add another level of complexity, I created a way of increasing the difficulty algorithmically by collecting data on the user's performance. The most difficult part of this project was having to create the entire project from scratch with no direction or guidance. However, I also think the experience of personalizing a game from start to finish was rewarding in its own way. There were so many decisions involved in creating this game, and each design choice, approach, and algorithm was personally chosen. Though this project was challenging, it was the first project I had complete control over. From the entire process to the final product, it was a very personalized project that uniquely displayed my skills.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

Working closely with a team of experienced professionals from various backgrounds, such as therapists, technologists, and parents, who are all passionate about making a positive difference in the world, is exhilarating because it will help me improve my communication skills. Being able to work alongside the product team, participate in product meetings, and assume responsibility for particular product-related duties will contribute to my proficiency in product strategy, roadmap development, and implementation. Concurrently, customer research will afford me an opportunity to learn about user research, customer ethics, and empathy, all of which are fundamental skills for a product manager. Above all, the chance to improve my abilities in prototyping, product testing, and quality management is significant since it can facilitate my success as a product manager. Essentially, this internship will allow me to enhance my skills in all areas of product management and provide me with firsthand experience of working as a product manager. This experience will be complementary to my studies at UNC Chapel Hill and will provide me with the necessary foundation to attain my aspiration of becoming a thriving product manager in the future.

To guarantee the achievement of these learning objectives, I intend to devote my complete effort and remain actively engaged with the product and other employees throughout my internship. By being involved and engaged, I can acquire a better understanding of the product development process and learn from other experienced individuals in the field. I also believe that this will allow me to build strong professional relationships and improve my team working abilities, which are essential for success as a product manager. Therefore, I am committed to being an enthusiastic and engaged intern and making the most of this opportunity.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.156000+00:00

One of my personal interests and areas I would like to work toward in the future is children's education. Education is an important value of mine, and looking at the different education systems around the world, we can see the stark contrast between systems that are more developed than others. One area that I would like to use a large fund is to bridge this gap by creating more educational opportunities for marginalized communities. An idea to implement this is to develop a software program that is not only an educational tool but a platform for students to make connections and build their experience.

With a large fund, I think the first step to approaching this step would be hiring knowledgable educators to help build useful learning resources. This could range from tutoring videos to practice activities to even live question/answer sessions. These resources would create value by giving free access to a variety of tools based on a student's needs. A main goal of this idea would be for low-income students to have comparable educational experiences as the average student. Providing access to resources, counseling, and tutoring would allow them to have this extra boost that other students have.

Currently, programs that provide free educational tools exist, but this idea can expand a student's opportunities to also give them a place to connect with other students and educators. Students could find opportunities to build relationships that encourage their academic progress. They could have mentors to guide them, and I envision this would be helpful for high school students wanting to explore experiences in different domains. The program would not be limited to experiences on a screen but creating social connections as well.

A final feature of this program could be creating a dashboard for students to organize their personal academic goals and achievements. The software could lead students to other resources based on their goals. This could start a student's pathway to careers and broaden their opportunities outside of their community as well. 

It would be instrumental to create a single software that meets various needs of a student. The average student is able to access these tools and experiences with little difficulty, but in marginalized communities, there is not only a lack of resources but more importantly, opportunities. This idea would be providing these students with information and technology to build their academia with quality resources.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

Over the next two weeks, I had to keep reminding myself - I tore my ACL, and it will be a yearlong recovery. 12 months. This was an injury that even professional athletes sometimes didn’t recover from, how would I? I spent that summer and fall unable to walk properly, mostly confined to my house. It was as if I was living through the height of the covid pandemic again! As a previously athletic person, the mental toll of losing my main source of meditation and social outlet was unlike anything I had ever dealt with before. Framing small things, such as the first time I was able to walk without crutches to my neighborhood ice cream store with a friend, into memorable and positive experiences helped get me through.  
I am currently in the middle of my recovery, working with a physical therapist to strengthen my quad muscles and get back to doing the things I love - hoping I can get back to running this summer. One of the positives that came out of this ordeal was that I found a love for weightlifting. I tried to get into it over the years, but usually gave up. This time though, since it was the only form of exercise I could participate in, I dove in deep and began amassing proper knowledge regarding anatomy, muscle building, nutrition, etc. I have been working out consistently every week since last September and know that it will be a habit in my life for years to come.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.159000+00:00

aOPgHSU82zwv,dESsecix,gh4e6b8w78sl5zsm4gh4xfwuti0qkkmh,text,,,,"A result I'm most proud of would be creating a mobile service for a toy company. For many design projects, I struggled feeling whether my skills were adequate enough because I lacked a background in visual design. However, as I worked on more projects and became more exposed to design techniques, I felt myself becoming more comfortable and creative with design. I think this project was meaningful for me because it was a project I felt very involved in and passionate about. From brainstorming to  making design choices, I felt the ideas and concepts I had to offer helped make some important decisions. 

I think this project was also one I felt the most passionate about. Our team was challenged to think about creating a mobile service in a different way. Melissa & Doug emphasizes creating toys to enhance children’s play in a screen-free environment, but creating a service that shifts the focus to a screen would undermine their goals. Our team thought of possible ways we could still create a mobile service without taking away the creative and engaging experience of playing with toys. Our team decided to create a service that could emphasize these memories of play through a time capsule service that logs the journey of a toy. Children would still have their full childhood experience in a screen-free zone, and parents would be able to log their children’s favorite memories, which could be replayed when the children are older. The goals of our service were to create a sense of nostalgia and source of keeping core childhood memories. 

Having a background working with children, I think I felt passionate about letting kids be kids. Nowadays so many kids are tied to a screen, and many times, it's done in an unhealthy way. I feel strongly about letting kids build social and healthy experiences that allow them to exercise their minds, grow their curiosity, and enhance their creativity.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

I'm happy you provided an option to disable the Safelist. But why do conversations with ""unapproved"" contacts still show in the ""Needs Review"" tab? 

When my child is included in a large group chat (youth group or several friends) it is just not feasible to approve all the numbers without texting each individual to identify themselves. I really hate the contact management piece of your product.  Just being able to read the conversations is sufficient to make sure my child is not getting lured away by some stranger.

Overall, I like pinwheel because it doesn't allow my child to spend all day watching videos or whatever else they would do with internet access.  But pinwheel is very, very far from a finished product and I feel frustrated every time I use it.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:32:30.503000+00:00

I know that parents want their kids to have lots of apps, but if the phone doesn't work smoothly it's very frustrating. I also think that there should be more consideration put into what free or paid apps on considered...a lot of the apps on iOS or Android require payment through the account on the phone it was bought on and they do not have an external log-on. You just buy it on the phone and that phone has that app. In a millions years I DO NOT think that Pinwheel should add internet access for this purpose. These phones should not have internet access. But that does mean that apps need to be more carefully considered based on their paid or free features. Apps that don't have a way to externally buy and then log-into on the Pinwheel phone are probably not a good fit for the phone",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:34:48.324000+00:00

For many of us, the commute consists of a series of buses, trains and planes – it’s pretty overwhelming to sift through all the options and you can never be quite sure that you’re getting the best fit for your needs. 
To address that, I thought of a web-app idea in which a student can type in a location and find a list of transportation options, something like an Expedia, but for every leg of a trip. The app will then retrieve and display data, like bus fare or plane price for a specific time. The user can filter by mode or price to find the best ride for their needs. 
The need for a product like this expands far past the Cornell campus that it was originally brainstormed for – anyone that travels using public and private transportation would benefit from it. 
Before bringing this vision to life, I would first conduct user research to quantify the need for the app. This would span people from all walks of life and also from a geographically diverse pool. Once I’ve ascertained the market for the product and what features the users would like to see in the app, I would gather a small team of developers, designers and a PM that are hopefully as passionate about the product as I am. Then we would create a minimum viable product before beta testing with a small group of users. Over time, the product will only become more sophisticated, and hopefully the consumer base will continue to grow as well.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.159000+00:00

Alongside my academic and athletic commitments, I was also serving as a teaching assistant for one of my classes and as a product manager for an algorithmic trading project.

Managing all of these responsibilities simultaneously was extremely challenging, both mentally and physically. I often found myself working late into the night to keep up with assignments and projects, and waking up early for practice was exhausting. However, I learned a lot about time management and prioritization during that time, and I'm proud of myself for being able to juggle so many different commitments successfully.

However, after taking some time to reflect, I realized that the feedback was valid, and I needed to work on my delegation and leadership skills. To address this issue, I spoke with the person who had given me the feedback and asked for specific examples of when they felt I was being too controlling. I also took a step back from planning the next event and allowed others to take the lead on certain tasks. I made a conscious effort to delegate more effectively and to listen to the ideas and suggestions of others. Over time, I was able to build stronger relationships with the other members of the club and work more effectively as a team.

Healthcare costs are skyrocketing due to the high demand and limited supply of medical professionals. To tackle this global issue, I propose developing a platform that uses cutting-edge generative AI technology to diagnose patients.

Here's how it works: patients will describe their symptoms to a chatbot, which will use sophisticated algorithms to filter out medical conditions that don't fit the presented symptoms. Next, the patient will use their smartphone camera to take a picture of the affected area. The platform will then use object recognition technology to compare the image to a database of similar cases and provide the best possible match.

Finally, the platform will provide the patient with a detailed recovery plan, including recommended treatments and medications, as well as follow-up instructions. This approach would revolutionize healthcare delivery by making diagnosis and treatment accessible to people regardless of their location or financial circumstances.

With this platform, patients could receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment without having to visit a doctor's office. This would greatly reduce healthcare costs and make healthcare more accessible to people in remote areas or those with limited mobility. Overall, I believe that this platform has the potential to transform the way we think about healthcare and revolutionize medical diagnosis and treatment.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.156000+00:00

With Ting I was unsuccessful getting the GPS location to successfully ping the phone if my child left our immediate city limits in Sandpoint ID 83864. For example couldn't find her while at Silverwood. Coverage was also hit and miss at my Child's grandparents house which is outside city limits as well. We had to reinstall the SIM card several times to get the phone to make calls successfully on the ting network. 2) We also have Ting internet at our home which has also been awful due to our old plaster and walls they say. We are currently without internet as we try something different with them; a mesh system. We have not gotten it up and running so without internet my child can't log into the phone after i had to reinstall her SIM card again today. She can receive calls and text but can't initiate either without being able to log in. 3) occasionally the time on the phone gets off and then the modes don't work correctly. 4) Basically whenever something goes wrong with the phone, which is nearly daily, I'm asking an 11 year old to problem solve how to fix it, which she is just not capable of doing. We just need simple phone and text capability, reliably, and we are just not getting it.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:34:58.209000+00:00

It's a tough balance - too much time on either and the other falls to the wayside. He's almost so cross functional that he finds himself needed in a thousand places at once. (Genius problems, right??) 
Suggestion here would be to be intentional about time allocation for each, communicate that clearly to the team, and then MAINTAIN it. This creates consistency, adjusts people's real expectations, and allows them to adjust their needs/asks (on BOTH sides) of Isaiah accordingly.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:35:14.740000+00:00

We never got the SIM card and had to go to TMobile, then using the phone has been challenging every step of the way and I've had to text and call customer service numerous times. Then today I asked my daughter to see if she could dial me - since I'm her emergency contact and she should be able to do that no matter what - and she couldn't even do that. Before getting the phone I compared Pinwheel to Gabb and other things, and chose very carefully. Unfortunately it feels like the Pinwheel phone is a great idea and well thought out in terms of child development but it doesn't feel ready for market yet.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:34:58.202000+00:00

I don't like having to refresh the page to see movement on the screen. The Live Status has been inaccurate in that area, taking a few seconds to a few minutes to refresh, especially when the phone is on the move. I find this to be a HUGE issue for parents that want to keep a close eye on their kids to allow them to have more independence. Like Life360, I also wish the Live Status had the option of showing the history of where the child has been.
Because Life360 isn't working properly, I am unable to see where our child is when he's on the move.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:34:48.323000+00:00

It was so large that he thinks when he was changing clothes in a bathroom it possibly fell out of his pocket unbeknownst to him. The location services were not working to find the phone, which doesn't make sense. That was probably the main thing. What's the point of having location on if it doesn't work 'unless it's unlocked', which is what I was told. Second, I didn't have another $350 to buy a new phone. Since there is not a replacedment option for a discounted rate, we went ahead and just got him a regular phone...ugh. I didn't want to do that but size and the limited access to honing in on where the phone was turned us off.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:31:53.250000+00:00

Sometimes we don't know what he's thinking/where he's headed vision wise and strategically, and I think that's a weakness. We're all behind him, but we don't always know where we're going.
Additionally, Dane is actually the nicest, most gracious person ever. However, he isn't always as approachable as he could be. I think this is based in concern over his reaction (since he doesn't always just say what he's thinking) and a lack of certainty over how things will be received. To improve this, Dane could be more intentional about proactively inviting (and even pushing for) feedback and people's thoughts. A trend with this group of people seems to be that many won't take even an invitation to share their thoughts/give feedback/articulate their concerns, but if you're consistent in pushing for it then they end up being all too happy to share with someone they know will listen carefully and share back with them.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:35:14.740000+00:00

However, these are our hangups about it: Texts from parents (emergency contacts!) were not going through to him. How many more did he miss from friends that he never received? He has to reload his phone several times to see notifications. (How does he know to do this if he's not with us? What about in an emergency?!) One parent login for the caregiver portal? Thankfully we are not a single parent or blended family! My son has TWO parents that would like to be involved! Modes do not consistantly change when they're supposed to, regardless of which device the modes were changed on. (An example is that my son got his phone for the last 4 days of school. He was not able to do anything on his phone the last day of school even though we had changed it the night before to every thing mode. Talk about frustrating! Now he has some friends that he will not be able to communicated over the summer!) I also want to throw in that I joined the Thriving Families group on Facebook. These same issues were complained about a year ago. How is it that a company that has been doing this over a year and charges $15 a month per phone has not fixed this yet. We really wanted this phone to work but we are not willing to deal with the frustrations any more!",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:34:39.424000+00:00

I want them to have a phone to call and message close friends and family members without worrying she'll get addicted to games and social media. If I have to research every app I download on her phone now how are you different than the rest of the phones? Please continue the way you have been doing business so far.",,,,,,,,2023-11-07 14:33:30.314000+00:00

As an individual who values careful planning and calculated risks, I was hesitant to embrace my brother's spontaneity. When my brother first suggested cliff jumping, my initial reaction was to dismiss it as too risky. I knew that cliff jumping could be dangerous, especially if you are not experienced or familiar with the area. However, my brother was persistent and convinced that it would be a thrilling experience. I decided to take a more assertive approach and proposed that we look into safer options. After researching different activities, we came across skydiving, which was surprisingly not only safer but also more regulated in New Zealand. I presented this alternative to my brother and explained why it was a better option. Through teamwork and thorough research, we were able to make an informed decision that ultimately led to a once-in-a-lifetime experience of jumping 15,000 feet from a plane - no big deal compared to arguing with a 16 year old boy, right? And while the experience was undoubtedly exhilarating, it taught me an important lesson about embracing uncertainty and taking risks in a responsible and informed manner. By leveraging my ability to analyze and synthesize information, and my willingness to take calculated risks, I am confident in my ability to make sound decisions in any situation. Ultimately, this experience reinforced my belief that teamwork, careful planning, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to great rewards. Also, there isn't much 16 year old boys are afraid of.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.157000+00:00

The main purpose of this app comes from the common situation where couples will go on a date together but have no one to nice photos for them without hiring an expensive private photographer. And while they could always ask people around them, no one wants to be that person who asks a stranger to keep retaking the photo until they like it (“Does this photo look ok?” “Yes, of course! Thanks!” <-- usually said without even looking at the picture taken). As the number of the same repackaged dating apps increase, I want to introduce this idea as a fresh accompaniment. 

With a million dollars to jumpstart this idea, the first thing I would do is hire a team. Although I may have an idea in its early stages, in order to see this product through to the end, I believe I need a team that I can trust and rely on. Whether through an application process or asking around my friends, I will build a balanced team that isn’t just computer science heavy, but with foundations in a breadth of fields. For this stage of my project, my motto will be “I hope I’m not the smartest person in this room”. 

Once I have a team that I am satisfied with, I will begin the development stages of my project. I hope to follow a structure that is rigid enough where it is organized, but flexible enough where my team will have room to improvise and try things out. In terms of the actual development, first we will host weekly meetings in which each member goes over what they are planning to do and what they have accomplished already. We will go over and analyze any current issues or potential obstacles to the product. Then, we will rework our structure for the app to accommodate these changes. Once we have gone through this cycle a number of times, hopefully within around 6 months, we will have a prototype that is usable and functions without any severe bugs. An important feature of my app I would like to implement during this phase is how couples are matched with their “third wheel”. My vision for the interface is that couples pay a membership fee to join the app, and they will then release their event listing with the date, time, and specific needs. There will be a base price to hire a “third wheel” priced by the hour, which covers simple tasks like taking candid photos during the duration of the date and taking photos when asked to. There will also be an option for more unique dates to accommodate for couples who may just need another body for reservations to restaurants or attractions, as some only take reservations for parties of 3 or more. The third wheel can then give a like for the events they are interested in, and be matched with a couple that accepts them. The incentive for the third wheel is to get paid (The hourly base wage + some amount of money from our seed funding, which will eventually turn into money from the membership fees) or go to events they may not normally get to go to (Free meal at restaurants that the couple and company splits, participation in escape rooms or tours, etc.).  

Third, with all the remaining money, I would buy as many eco-friendly tricycles as possible and donate them to local schools in the area. Because who doesn’t need a third wheel :)",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

While working on one of our assignments, I noticed that we were not following the instructions that our professor had introduced in class. However, I didn't bring it up to the team because I thought it might not be a big deal. Unfortunately, our grade suffered as a result. We were all upset, and when I told my team that the professor actually taught that in class, one of my group members criticized me for not speaking up earlier.

Feeling frustrated and wronged, I initially wanted to defend myself and blamed my team members for not paying attention in class. However, I soon realized that this was not the right attitude to have. I took a step back, took a deep breath, and tried to see the situation from their perspective. I acknowledged that, while I had known the information, I had not effectively communicated it to the group. I realized that I needed to be more proactive in communicating my concerns and in ensuring that everyone was on the same page.

With this realization, I expressed to my team that I would make an effort to be more vocal in the future and encouraged us to work together more effectively. 

From this experience, I learned that it is crucial to voice my concerns and to communicate effectively within a team. Nothing is too small to bring up, especially when I have concerns or doubts. It's important to be an active participant and to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals. By doing so, I was able to turn this difficult feedback into a valuable learning experience that has helped me to become a better team player.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.157000+00:00

It is here that I met Madesh. 

One evening, I noticed Madesh looking slightly distraught and he shared his grief of being unable to afford education for his son, Manju. For me, learning his reality was heartbreaking. I took a moment to reassure him and decided to do everything in my power to help as I believe in the promise of opportunity that education opens for all.

I researched for schools that offered education to underprivileged children. This led me to ‘Bridge-School’, which provides free education to the needy. I was happy to share with Madesh that Manju could secure admission at the school. The look on his face was priceless as this education will offer Manju upward mobility in life. Later, I realized there are 100s who can’t afford basic education in my grandparents’ vicinity.

I created awareness about this school and further helped many such children get access to free schooling and decided to volunteer with ‘Bridge-School’ myself, where I taught Mathematics and English. I continue to pursue this endeavor at the ‘Shiv Nadar Foundation’, once my grandparents relocated to Delhi. Through the pandemic, we crowdfunded to arrange tablets for children so they could continue their education online.

One of my goals will always be to develop an enlightened future for the underprivileged, where they can get fair opportunities to turn fearless dreams into reality!",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.156000+00:00

The game had over 100,000 attendees, and our volunteer crew (which had only half the recommended number of staff due to a staffing shortage) lacked any prior experience in cooking the foods.
The sheer volume of people was overwhelming, and the pressure to keep up with demand was intense. I was constantly on my feet, trying to prepare food quickly and efficiently while also ensuring that everything was cooked properly and up to standard.
In addition, the fact that there were only 7 other volunteers, rather than the recommended 15, made it challenging to manage the workload and maintain a high level of customer service. It was a test of my organizational skills, as I had to prioritize tasks and ensure that everything was running smoothly despite the challenges. We ended up running only 5 registers rather than 8 because it was much easier to have 3 dedicated ""runners"" fulfilling orders instead of each cashier getting their own order.

But after discussing with the team, I took a positive outlook and suggested we could pivot our idea to solve a similar need. We came up with a renting platform for college students for clothes. This experience taught me to always do proper research and not become demotivated by setbacks. Moreover, I also became aware of the negative impact sunk cost biases can have on a team’s success.

Our clients were looking for us to create a more modern, interactive, and intuitive website that highlights their brand values. Therefore, I implemented these changes and checked back in with them. Since my clients were a bit on the elderly side, they extremely disliked the look of the new website as our aesthetic design choices did not match. They disagreed with the way some of the content was written, the color scheme, typography, and much more. With this feedback, I asked them what they were envisioning and worked with two other designers to create multiple versions of what our clients wanted. In an effort to be more time efficient, I delegated tasks for each designer (including myself), and had one person focus on content, another on brand consistency, etc. This helped our client better explain what she was looking for, and also helped us come to an understanding on how to abide by ADA guidelines in a way that satisfies the clients and their customers' usability.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.159000+00:00

Initially, I was taken aback but thankful that he shared that with me.  After thinking about it, I realized just how correct he was.

I believe that effective communication is essential for building great products, and I'm eager to gain experience working with designers, engineers, marketers, and other stakeholders. Through this internship, I hope to become more adept at conveying my ideas, listening to feedback, and working collaboratively.

Secondly, I want to develop my product thinking process and skills. I'm eager to work on real-world projects that take into account business development, technical issues, and other factors. I want to learn how to identify user needs, come up with creative solutions, and measure the success of products over time.

Thirdly, I'm eager to gain a more detailed and vivid understanding of what a product manager role looks like. By shadowing experienced product managers and learning from their day-to-day experiences, I hope to gain insights into the different responsibilities and skills required for success in this field. This knowledge will help me make more informed decisions about my future career path.

Finally, I'm excited about gaining experience working at a startup and working on products for children and families. I believe that this experience will be invaluable in helping me understand the unique challenges and opportunities that come with building products for my dream target audience -- kids. Ultimately, I hope to work on similar products in the future that make a positive impact on people's lives.

To ensure that my learning goals are met during this internship, I would take a proactive approach to my personal and professional development. This means regularly reflecting on my progress toward my goals, self-assessing my strengths and areas for improvement, and taking initiative to seek out opportunities that align with my learning objectives.

I believe that seeking feedback from my colleagues and supervisors would also be crucial in achieving my goals.

One relevant experience I have is when I was working on a documentation example for UnityLink, which is a feature where the Wolfram Language can be used as an interface for the Unity Game Engine. For this project, I was given little instruction and had to be creative to come up with an example that many people would find interesting and could relate to. With this vision in mind, I thought back to my own personal experiences with music and how one of the most basic challenges with learning an instrument is affording the instrument itself. I decided to create a tutorial on how to create a simple piano using the Wolfram language. The goal behind this project was to democratize music for anyone with access to technology and take advantage of the public aspect of the internet. This project took several weeks and lots of discussion between my manager, myself, and other team members, but in the end, I was able to see the completion of a product I designed.

In the middle of my busy school life, leading to balance the pressure and the difficulties of thriving in a demanding environment was challenging. In particular, we went on a field training exercise where we trained in the dessert for three days. During this time, we went on an 8 mile hike with inclines and rocky roads where I was beginning to break in my new pair of combat boots. This was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done—where I needed to March for 8 miles in concrete hard boots and follow the cadence while responding to commands. I came home with blisters and swollen ankles. Even if it was difficult when I mentally and physically am really struggling to pick myself up, I always think back to the 8-mile March and think about how I preserved then.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

I discussed with the CEO the resources we could provide women to break into tech, and we created software that matches the women in the GenShe network to top startups while creating a network of women who uplift each other. Working on a product from start to finish, from ideation to beta launching, gave me the perspective that the PM who is handling the product not only handles the process but also the nuance of how the product is positioned in the world. I found myself excited by the notion that each product can have my perspective woven into it and I realized the importance of guiding myself into the right headspace to ensure that the product is streamlined for success and impact. With this notion, I became a product manager for many different spaces, including my own startup, On The Table, TEDxCornellUniversity’s development team, and even my pro-bono consulting engagements. For both On The Table and my client in the engagement, we work with food and beverage products. However, even if the end goal is not a digital product, the process from start to finish looks incredibly similar. With my knowledge of ideating and iterating, I’ve been able to improve the product and experience of both OTT and my client’s business. Using a PM’s perspective as standard practice in my team has helped us be the consumer while also being the creator, helping us work hand-in-hand with our community to deliver better products and have more impact. To dig deeper, there were even teams like TEDxCornellUniversity that did not have a product manager. There was a design team and an engineering team, but they were misaligned, leading to miscommunication and even big disagreements that would set our entire team back by months. I used my skills of delegating tasks, managing people, and overall striking a delicate balance between engineers and designers to get the website finished in 3 weeks, when it had taken so long to  even get started. I think the manner and practices of a PM can greatly affect the product, team environment, and mission which is why I want to be a PM so, I can use my unique background to create better products and better impact.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

While I do miss my friends and family back home, I have noticed significant personal and mental growth through my experience of being away.

mXvC2GORFaWf,dESsecix,wbubta1joidaieeuwbubtqh23nzjzteo,text,,,,"I've always been intrigued by the world of business because of the opportunities it presents to not just think critically, but for the fact that it also nurtures an attitude of leadership and team spirit which is so essential for success. Growing up in a business family, I was exposed to this world at a very young age. Even today, I recall my first exposure to business and its intricacies. I was all of 10 and it was a visit to my uncle's factory. The whole experience of walking through an industrial enterprise was so fascinating that it influenced my thoughts to a great extent. This interest in me was fanned by the environment I grew up in and by the time I was in Senior School, it was a given that product management would be my calling.

My fascination and passion for product management drove me to take up Business Management and Economics at High School. Participating in the ‘TiE Young Entrepreneurs Program’, and competing in the ‘Tiger Global Case Competition’ and the University of Arizona's ‘Studentpreneur Challenge’ has given me an insight into what product management and entrepreneurship is all about. I also completed online courses like Google's ‘The Fundamentals of Digital Marketing’ and IBM's ‘Data Analytics for Everyone’, amongst others. In my quest to expand my awareness of the subject beyond the walls of my school I have written a research paper about Tesla's expansion into China. To become more skilled in product management, I am pursuing a Business Administration and Information Science degree with a minor in Entrepreneurship at college. I'm also involved in UNC Product Management Club, collaborating with startups to develop apps and support their product management teams. Furthermore, I'm gaining practical experience as a Marketing and Special Events Assistant intern at the UNC Institute for the Environment, which is helping me advance my knowledge and get closer to achieving my goal of becoming a product manager.

Whether through books, courses, or internships I keep myself constantly linked and updated with the world of business. I know the days ahead are going to be both promising and challenging. I am eagerly looking forward to the Product Management Summer internship with Pinwheel, for it will be the ultimate icing on the cake!",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.156000+00:00

In fact, lower levels of a specific pesticide, or insecticides, can even result in more crop production. I would like to help optimize pesticide usage on crops in order to prevent over-usage (which can lead to harmful health and environmental problems) by creating a novel nozzle design. Oftentimes, farmers are spreading an excess of unnecessary pesticides due to the spray nozzle. Being able to optimize the nozzle by using a smart controlled app could be a more sustainable solution. To approach creating this smart controlled app, the first step would be to conduct market research and assess the issue, existing solutions, and customer needs. The next step would be idea development and fine-tuning the specifications of the product idea/hypothesis. The final step would consist of laying out a roadmap that involves milestones, product features, challenges, and more so that the product can start getting built. Eventually, the prototype should be tested and feedback should be collected.",,,,,,,,2023-05-09 15:55:30.158000+00:00

Many people are familiar with the subject through Game Theory (i.e. Prisoner's Dilemma, etc.), but the subject has much more substance than that. It's primarily about how we, as individuals or groups, operate outside of market incentives. It can best be thought of as ""what we do when there isn't a supply and demand curve?"". 
As someone who loves philosophy, I feel this subject really gets at the core of why we make the decisions we do. Economics, to me, isn't primarily a study of markets, but rather how we view choice.
